Zynga Scroller for jQuery
==============

An easy way to add the great Zynga Scroller to any jQuery project.

Based on: http://zynga.github.com/scroller/

This port only utilizes the scrolling features, and doesn't 
include zooming or pull to refresh. Although, we do have the
option to set a default offset for our scrollable areas, so
that's kind of a bonus.

Plus, the minified version is only 15k!
